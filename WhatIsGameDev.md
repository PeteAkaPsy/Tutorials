# What Is GameDev and Who can call himself a Game Developer

Game Development basically is everything that is done to Create a Game. So Everyone that is involved in the Creation Process of a Game itself is a Game Developer.
In smaller Teams, the members might have multiple Roles and in bigger Teams more specific than the ones listed below.

## What Departments exist in GameDev
There are many Departments or Roles in GameDev that are Possible, but most of them are yust a more specific variant of some of the basic Roles. So the Following Roles are only the most basic Roles.

### Producer
The Game-Producer is a Person that Manages the Project and keeps an eye on the planning to keep the Development in order and in Time, as Game Development can cost much monney when delays start occuring.

### Designer
The Game-Designer is a Person wo creates the Rules of the Game and often also does the work of a Level Designer or Tester.

### Programmer
The Game-Programmer is a Person that writes the Code that implements the Rules from the Game-Designer and Compiles(Translates) the Code into Computer language that your computer then can Run. He basically creates the Application.

### Artist
The Artist is a Person who Creates the Content of a Game, this are mostly the Visual and Audible things. An Artist can be categorized into the following General Roles:
- 2D-Artists: creates Textures or Sprites/Pixel-Art that gets used for Backgrounds, User-Interfaces or the Textures of 3D Models
- 3D-Artists: creates 3D Models and might also Create Animations, but is mostly split into the following more specific roles:
  - Environment-Artist: creates the Environment Models for a Level and sometimes also does Level-Design.
  - Character-Artist: creates the Playable Characters or NPC Characters and might also Animate them
  - there are/might be more Roles, but they are much more specific
- Musician/Composer: yes this is also an Artist Role and Creates the Music and/or Sound-Effects

### Technical-Artist
The Technical-Artist is a combination of an Artist and a Programmer. It is a Person that mostly writes Shaders or very math heavy code or does optimizations for complex calculations. For this Role you need 

### Tester
The Tester basically Plays the Game and also sometimes Plays it in a way not intended, basically trying to Break the Game to find Bugs/Errors.
Also after a patch was made the Tester is checking the BugFixes to asure that a Bug is actually Fixed and is not creating a new Bug.

## And where do i start now?
After Reading about the Roles you should Pick one, but at the same Time you want to learn the absolute basics of most of the Roles.
The reason for this is, that everyone working on a prototype needs to know how to create Placeholders to keep working on it without Disruption.
Also everyone can be a Game-Designer and Help adding cool new Features or decide which features need to be cut to get a Game Finished.
